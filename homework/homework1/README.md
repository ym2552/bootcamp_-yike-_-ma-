## Project title
Electricity Load Forecasting with PCA for Risk Management in Power Markets
**Stage 01** - Problem Framing & Scoping
### Problem Statement
- In today's energy markets, anticipating electricity demand is crucial because precise projections enable utilities, grid operators, and financial institutions to better manage risks and distribute resources. The price of electricity might fluctuate significantly in a matter of hours, for example, from 5 RMB to 15 RMB. The intricacy of several coupled and nonlinear elements, including temperature, humidity, fossil fuel costs, and renewable energy, is difficult for traditional forecasting models to handle. In order to solve this, I suggest reducing dimensionality and extracting important features from these inputs using Principal Component Analysis (PCA model). This makes it possible to create a prediction model that more accurately depicts the ways in which fuel prices, storage, renewable energy sources, and weather impact the increase of the national load.

### Stakeholder & User
The primary stakeholders are grid operators (for example: State Grid Corporation of China) and financial institutions involved in electricity futures markets. Grid operators rely on accurate demand forecasts to balance supply and demand in real time, avoiding blackouts and minimizing costs. Financial institutions and energy traders use forecasts to price electricity futures, hedge risks, and design trading strategies. To sum up, firsthand how forecasts drive operational and financial decisions.

### Useful Answer
The given weather and market conditions, how much electricity demand will change at the national level. Then, the useful answer is predictive. The artifact is a forecasting model that incorporates PCA to manage high-dimensional inputs. Metrics such as RMSE and MAPE will be used to evaluate performance. Additionally, the model can highlight nonlinear effects—e.g., how temperature and wind interact to alter demand, or how new demand drivers like EVs and data centers shift load growth.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- Past data can be used to predict future demand patterns. Relationships between inputs and demand are nonlinear but can be captured via PCA and modeling. The model assumes that macro demand trends (e.g. EV adoption, data center growth) can be estimated and incorporated.
### Known Unknowns / Risks
- Policy changes may affect change demand drivers unpredictably. Moreover, forecasting extreme spikes in demand may have challenge (similar to volatility spikes in financial markets).

### Lifecycle Mapping
- Goal → Stage → Deliverable mapping bullets Data Preprocessing → Workable dataset → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality → Build baseline models → Incorporate nonlinear effects and load growth factors (EVs, data centers) → Backtesting to ensure robustness → Hyperparameter tuning → Improve model quality → Evaluation of models (RMSE, MAPE) → Compare performance and show the best model

### Repo Plan
- /data/ stores raw and processed datasets, /src/ stores source code, /notebooks/ contains exploratory analysis and modeling, /docs/ holds stakeholder memos and documentation; update cadence depends on data frequency (daily or weekly)
